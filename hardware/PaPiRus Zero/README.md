#Clarification of pinout for buttons 

The schematic labels switches SW1 to SW5 as well as the signal lines to those buttons (signals are labeled BUT1 to BUT5) but confusingly the signals to specific switches do not maintain the same number as the switch.

Below is a clarification to make this a little less confusing:

SW1 = BUT5 = pin 40 = GPIO 21

SW2 = BUT4 = pin 36 = GPIO 16

SW3 = BUT1 = pin 38 = GPIO 20

SW4 = BUT3 = pin 35 = GPIO 19

SW5 = BUT2 = pin 37 = GPIO 2
